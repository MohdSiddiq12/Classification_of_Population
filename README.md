  <!-- Project Title -->
  <h1>🌐 Population Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering</h1>

  <!-- Overview Section -->
  <h2>🌐 Overview</h2>
  <p>This project focuses on the segmentation of population segments using K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique. By applying clustering algorithms, the marketing team can gain insights into distinct population groups in different regions of the country. Leveraging demographic data and other relevant features, the project aims to optimize marketing efforts for improved efficiency and customer engagement.</p>

  <!-- Objectives Section -->
  <h2>🎯 Objectives</h2>
  <p>The primary objective is to develop a robust clustering model that accurately segments the population. This segmentation will empower the marketing team to understand the characteristics of different population groups, leading to more effective and targeted marketing strategies.</p>

  <!-- Methodology Section -->
  <h2>🔍 Methodology</h2>
  <p>The project utilizes K-Means clustering, an unsupervised learning technique, to analyze and categorize the population. By clustering individuals based on their features, the algorithm can identify distinct population segments, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing campaigns.</p>
