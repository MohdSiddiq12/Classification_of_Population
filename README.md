  <!-- Project Title -->
  <h1>👥 Classification of Population Using Logistic Regression</h1>

  <!-- Overview Section -->
  <h2>🌐 Overview</h2>
  <p>This project focuses on the classification of population segments using logistic regression, a machine learning technique. By employing logistic regression, the marketing team can launch targeted promotional campaigns in different regions of the country. Leveraging demographic data and other relevant features, the project aims to optimize marketing efforts for improved efficiency and customer engagement.</p>

  <!-- Objectives Section -->
  <h2>🎯 Objectives</h2>
  <p>The primary objective is to develop a robust logistic regression model that accurately segments the population. This segmentation will empower the marketing team to tailor promotional campaigns based on the characteristics of different population groups, leading to more effective and targeted marketing strategies.</p>

  <!-- Methodology Section -->
  <h2>🔍 Methodology</h2>
  <p>The project utilizes logistic regression, a classification technique, to analyze and categorize the population. By training the model on historical data and relevant features, the logistic regression algorithm can predict the likely response of different population segments to specific marketing campaigns.</p>
